# Taki-Language
A constructive language of mine. 

## What's the goal with this?
To be frank, I don't really know. Maybe the idea is to write poetries or stories? Or whatever that comes to the head of those who learns it. It's like Toki Pona in this kind of sense -- simplistic, without that much of boilerplate in it. 

### What are the languages I'm basing myself on?
Mainly Portuguese, English and French. And other languages that I don't know that much but I still like it: Like _Russian_, _German_, _Polish_, _Mandarin Chinese_, _Japanese_ and so on...

## What I will be posting here?
I hopefully hope to post the spreadsheet with the vocabulary, and some texts I will be doing with the language (Translations & Original Texts).
